Pyghack 2018 project, CU tree/flooding data

We decided to work on the [Urbana Trees and Green Infrastructure data project](https://github.com/cudsug/urbana-trees-analysis/).

> # Urbana Trees and Green Infrastructure
> Overview:
>
> The City of Urbana Stormwater Utility collects fees from commercial and residential properties to fund maintenance and improvement of the Cityâ€™s stormwater management system. This system includes pipes, retention ponds, swales, ditches, etc. The Utility also provides incentives for private properties to detain, retain, infiltrate, or reuse stormwater onsite. The stormwater management system keeps stormwater from flooding properties and causing damage. Additionally, the City of Urbana Arbor Division maintains all the trees located between the sidewalk and the curb in the City. The Arbor Division plants, trims, and removes trees as necessary to cultivate an urban forest to provide provide beauty and shade.
>
> Problem Statement:
>
> How can we use tree location data, flood complaint data, and census data to achieve better urban forest outcomes and better stormwater outcomes? Are there trends in our street tree distribution and/or vacant tree sites? How does the current or recently planted distribution of trees relate to Census data categories? How does the distribution of flood complaints relate to Census data? How does our urban forest relate to flooding complaints in a larger green infrastructure system.
