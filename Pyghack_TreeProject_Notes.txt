Pyghack Notes
Combine 2 datasets (tree location, flood complaints, and census data)
to achieve better urban forest and stormwater outcomes

He said: the PIN number is a parcel number we can look up in the Urbana
city properties to get addresses/location

To Do List:
Take a subset of variables to see which ones are informative
Decide if we use flooding data: if yes, we need to get the addresses
Check how easy it is to get addresses (go to champaign county property lookup)
